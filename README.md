INTRODUCTION

The most important factors in predicting the price of a car are the age of the car, its make (and model), its mileage (the number of kilometers it has run) and its horsepower. Due to rising fuel prices, fuel economy (measured in miles per gallon) is also of prime importance. Other factors such as the volume of its cylinders (measured in cc), number of doors, its physical state, whether it is automatic or manual transmission may influence the price as well.

In this project, we investigate the application of supervised machine learning techniques to predict the price based on different features of the car. Different techniques like linear regression analysis, and decision trees have been used to make the predictions.


CONCLUSION

A seemingly easy problem turned out to be indeed very difficult to resolve with high accuracy. All the four methods provided comparable performance. In the future, we intend to use more sophisticated algorithms to make the predictions. 


ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

I would like to extend my sincere thanks to my mentor, Mr. Malineni Maurya, as the success and final outcome of this project necessitated a lot of guidance and assistance.
